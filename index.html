      <p>It all started with me joining and sitting next to you. We started of just as everyone else normal classmates, until we didnt. 
        We both saw a connection of sort and latched to it. By the start of our 12th we were good friends. Then during 12th we grew more. 
        We shared our traumas, our feelings and our secrets. Until one day we became inseperable. Then thru the whole time we faced so much.
        Rumors, Distance, Failiures , Heart Breaks and what not.

      <p>Thru thick and thin you have held me and my hand. With every fall of mine you stood and helped while i just tried to push you away. 
      Everytime I do this and you still show up and say " Koi ni. Mai hu tere sath"
      Even when i am writing this my eyes are well filled. Bhai I cant express things in words rn. 
      Bolne ko bahut kuch hai lekin abi kuch nahi hai.

    <h2>Apology</h2>

    <p>Dear Saniya,</p>
    <p>I am truly sorry for my actions...</p>

    <p>I hope this message finds you, even if it's in a moment of uncertainty. I've spent a lot of time reflecting on
      us, on our journey together, and the gravity of my actions. I want to sincerely apologize for any pain I may have
      caused you.</p>

    <p>Our journey, marked by countless shared moments and memories, holds a special place in my heart. From the
      laughter that echoed through the years to the quiet moments that spoke volumes, each step we took together was a
      testament to the love I feel for you.</p>

    <p>I want you to know that my love for you has always been unwavering. In the midst of challenges and
      misunderstandings, it remains a constant force in my life. I cherish the unique bond we share, and the thought of
      losing that connection is something I cannot bear.</p>

    <p>Ik har baar ye hi krta hu mai. I push everyone away when I am scared thinking ki agr koi nahi hoga to shyd kam dukh ho.
    I dont think before doing things and i regret after doing them. Sending all that to you was the biggest mistake i could ever make
    Thinking ki pushing you away wont cause pain was dumb. </p>

    <p>As I express these sentiments, I want you to feel the depth of my remorse and the sincerity of my love. You are
      an integral part of my life, and the thought of causing you pain is a heavy burden that I carry. I am truly sorry.
      IK I am a bad friend. I know ki i am selfish but bhai one thing i do know is ki tujhe nhi kho skta mai. I should have 
      known better and held you thru.
    </p>

    <p>I understand that words alone may not be enough, but I am willing to do whatever it takes to make amends. Your
      happiness and our connection means the world to me.</p>

    <p>IK it wont be easy for you to trust me again. i also know ki shyd tu kabhi mujhe wapis as a Best Friend nhi regard kr payegi.
    Par bhai ho sake to can we rebuild this. I promise to not think of such things of everything not working out or doing something stupid if it doesnt.
    </p>

    <p>With all my love,Parth</p>

    <h3>A Symphony of Apology from My Falling Heart</h3>
    <h4>This letter is filled with sincere emotions and a cascade of falling hearts, symbolizing my heartfelt apology.
    </h4>



    <p>Dear Saniya,</p>

    <p>As I pen down these words, I find myself immersed in a sea of emotions, navigating the currents of our shared
      journey. Each stroke of the pen feels like a brush on the canvas of our story, painting a vivid picture of love,
      growth, and understanding.</p>

    <p>From the moment our paths first crossed to the challenges we faced and overcame, every chapter of our journey has
      etched itself into the tapestry of our shared existence. The laughter, the tears, the quiet moments — they all
      contribute to the symphony of our connection.</p>

    <p>Your presence in my life is like a gentle breeze, comforting and invigorating. Through the highs and lows, your
      unwavering support has been my anchor, grounding me in the warmth of our shared love.</p>

    <p>As we traverse the uncharted territories of life, I want you to know the profound impact you've had on my soul.
      Your essence is woven into the very fabric of who I am, and I am endlessly grateful for the depth of our
      connection.</p>

    <p>Thank you for being my confidant, my partner, and my greatest source of joy. With each passing day, my love for
      you deepens, and I look forward to the countless moments we have yet to create together.</p>

    <p>Forever your Companion</p>
